# Todos App - React

Todos App is a project I used to learn React/ES6. All todos are rendered when the page loads. A todo can be created, updated, or destroyed.

TodosApp does not utilize a database. I am building a React app for ideas that sends Axios requests to a Ruby on Rails JSON API with a PostgreSQL database.

While there are some things I would change, or do better/more succinctly, overall I am happy with the application. It was a great introduction to the more organized and efficient world of React.
